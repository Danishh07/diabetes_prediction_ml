# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning model to predict diabetes based on the Pima Indians Diabetes Database from Kaggle.

## 📈 Dataset Description

The dataset contains 768 samples with 8 features:
- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes pedigree function
- **Age**: Age (years)
- **Outcome**: Class variable (0 or 1) - Target variable

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**sklearn Warning about feature names:**
```
X does not have valid feature names, but GradientBoostingClassifier was fitted with feature names
```
**Solution**: This has been fixed in the latest version. The model now properly maintains feature names throughout the prediction pipeline.

**Model files not found:**
```
❌ Model files not found. Please run the training notebook first.
```
**Solution**: Run the complete notebook (`notebooks/diabetes_prediction_complete.ipynb`) to generate the required model files.
